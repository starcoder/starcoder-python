# Ongoing and future plans

1.  Data format compliance with [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/)
2.  Encoder-decoder pairs for other modalities (image, audio, video)
3.  More dropout mechanisms, particularly for relationships between entities
4.  Attention with positional encoding
5.  Configurable logging improvements
6.  Type hints and better data/model/class validation
7.  Switch to named tensors (depending on implementation state)
8.  Provide clear path for overriding/adding fields and models
9.  Switch Dataset reference system to be purely ID-based
10. Add "snowflake" batchifier
